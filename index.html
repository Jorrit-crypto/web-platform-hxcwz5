<h1>Compound Interest</h1>
<h2>Compound interest</h2>
 <p>This is distinct from simple <b>interest</b> in that interest is earned both on the original investment (the principal) and the interest accumulated so far, rather than simply on the principal. Because of this, accounts with compound interest grow faster than those with simple interest. For example, if your interest compounds annually, that means that youâ€™ll gain more interest in the second year after your investment than you did in the first year. Additionally, the value will grow even faster if the interest is compounded multiple times per year. Compound interest is offered on a variety of investment products and also charged on certain types of loans, like credit card debt.[1] Calculating how much an amount will grow under compound interest is simple with the right equations.</p>
